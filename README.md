# Image Identifier

This project is a react application that utilizes tensorflow.js to identify images. The user can upload an image of their own, paste an 
image url, or generate a random image using Unsplash's random image API.
The application will then generate 3 guesses on what the image could be and display the results. Each image will then be saved at the bottom of the page for future reference.
